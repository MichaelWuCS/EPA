# EPA
This is the project I worked on during my summer 2019 internship with the Environmental Protection Agency as a part of their Computational Exposure Division. Included here are two reports I wrote on the file. Specifically, I worked on the GLIMPSE graphical interface. GLIMPSE is the graphical interface for a program known as G-CAM and G-CAM-USA. These two programs are the most widely used predictive air quality computational models. GLIMPSE is the graphical interface which aims to make the GCAM model more intuitive and accessible for both scholars and policymakers.

In my summer here, I have focused primarily on improving the code of the graphical interface developed for the GCAM model, also known as GLIMPSE. I worked extensively on refactoring the code so that the structure of the code is more streamlined and follows standard good form coding practices. This increased readability of the code for future edits and for any future developers looking to modify and improve the code. In addition to refactoring and restructuring the existing code, I have implemented version control to allow for proper management of the project and edits to the code.
